## 🏷️ Title
**ProofOfBuilder: Decentralized Reputation & Governance Engine**

## 📝 Description
**ProofOfBuilder** is a comprehensive on-chain reputation protocol built on Stacks. It empowers developers to build a verifiable, decentralized identity based on their actual contributions and achievements.

Unlike static profiles, ProofOfBuilder aggregates on-chain activity into a dynamic **Builder Score**, unlocking tiered benefits within the ecosystem.

### Key Features
*   **Soulbound Identity (SBT):** A non-transferable token acting as the core builder profile.
*   **Achievement Badges (SIP-009):** Automated, tradeable NFTs awarded for milestones (e.g., "100 Day Streak", "Open Source Contributor").
*   **Community Governance:** A lightweight proposal system where voting power is weighted by reputation, ensuring a meritocratic ecosystem.
*   **Decentralized Marketplace:** Built-in royalty enforcement logic (SIP-009) to sustain the creator economy.

### Tech Stack
*   **Smart Contracts:** Clarity (Epoch 2.5)
*   **Standards:** SIP-009 (NFTs), SIP-010 (Tokens)
*   **Network:** Stacks Mainnet / Nakamoto Testnet

*Built for the Stacks Ecosystem to recognize and reward true builders.*
